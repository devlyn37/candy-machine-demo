# Candy Machine Demo

## What is this?
I put this together to see what NFTs are like in Solana. It started out as a buildspace project, but that used candy machine v1 so I just followed the metaplex docs and used their front-end boilerplate.

## How to run this
If you want to deploy a candy machine of your own take a look at these [docs](https://docs.metaplex.com/candy-machine-v2/introduction). 

To run the front-end: 

`cd app`

`yarn install && yarn start`
